# Group8_RGB-based_Action_Recognition



NTURGB+d Dataset:
- The NTURGB+d dataset is an extension of the NTU RGB+D dataset, which aims to facilitate human activity recognition and pose estimation tasks.
- It contains RGB and depth videos captured using a Kinect v2 sensor from 40 different subjects.
- The dataset covers a wide variety of human actions, including both daily and interactive activities, performed in various indoor and outdoor environments.
- The videos are captured from three camera views, resulting in a total of 80,000 action samples.
- Each video is labeled with a specific action class, representing the activity being performed in the video.

Label Format:
- The NTURGB+d dataset uses numerical labels to represent different action classes.
- The dataset consists of 60 action classes, each assigned a unique numerical value.
- For example, if there are 60 action classes, the labels could range from 1 to 60, with each number corresponding to a specific action category.

Acquiring the NTURGB+d Dataset:
- The NTURGB+d dataset is publicly available for research purposes.
- To acquire the dataset, you can visit the official website of the NTU RGB+D dataset (http://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/Datasets/actionRecognition.asp).
- On the website, you will find information about the dataset, including instructions on how to request access.
- Typically, you may need to register, agree to the dataset's terms of use, and provide details about your research project before gaining access to the dataset.
- The dataset is often provided as a set of downloadable files, including RGB and depth video clips, along with corresponding label files.

It's important to note that the availability and access procedure for the NTURGB+d dataset may have changed since my last knowledge update in September 2021. Therefore, I recommend visiting the official website mentioned above or conducting a search for the most up-to-date information on acquiring the NTURGB+d dataset.
